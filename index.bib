  Abstract                 = {Logos sometimes also known as trademark have high importance in today's marketing world. Products, companies and different gaming leagues are often recognized by their respective logos. In this paper, an implementation system for logo detection and recognition in video stream is presented. Feature set using SIFT (Scale Invariant Feature Transform) key-points is created for each query logo and the video frame being processed. The system uses a concept of bidirectional or two-way matching of features. Model fitting is carried out by using Random Sample Consensus (RANSAC) algorithm to suppress any outliers from two-way matching process. Also novel threshold scheme is used to finally make decision regarding presence of logo. Finally boundary is detected around the matched logo. The system provides various kinds of statistics like frequency of recognized logos, their visibility time and their locations in the video. Experiments were performed on various sports videos. The results of the experiments show that the developed system has achieved the precision rate of 89% and a recall of 99%.},

  Abstract                 = {The accuracy of today's document recognition algorithms falls abruptly when image quality degrades even slightly. In an effort to surmount this barrier, researchers have in recent years intensified their study of explicit, quantitative, parameterized models of the image defects that occur during printing and scanning. The author reviews the recent literature and discusses the form these models might take. A preview of a large public-domain database of character images, labeled with ground-truth including all defect model parameters, is given. The use of massive pseudo-randomly generated training sets for the construction of high-performance decision trees for preclassification is described. In a more theoretical vein, the author reports preliminary results in the estimation of the intrinsic error of precisely-specified text recognition problems. Finally, the author calls attention to some open problems},

  Abstract                 = {Handwriting recognition is an emerging subfield of human-computer interaction that has many potential industrial applications, e.g. in postal automation, bank check processing, and automatic form reading. Training a recognizer, however, requires a substantial amount of training examples together with their corresponding ground truth, which needs to be created by humans. A promising way to significantly reduce this effort, and hence cut system development costs, is offered by semi-supervised learning, in which both text with and text without transcription is used for training. However, until today there is no straightforward and established way of semi-supervised learning, particularly not for handwriting recognition. In the self-training approach, an initially trained recognition system creates a new training set from unlabeled data. Using this set, a new recognizer is created. The creation of the training set is done by selecting elements from the unlabeled set, according to their recognition confidence. The success of self-training depends crucially on the data selected. In this paper, we test and compare different rules used to select new training data for single word recognition with and without additional language information in the form of a dictionary. We demonstrate that it is possible to substantially increase the recognition accuracy for both systems.},

Technical issues include detection of the text image regions, perspective distortion normalization, binarization of character images in unknown colors, recognition of omnifont and decorative characters, word recognition and noun compound translation. Finally, an international collaboration on the development of the required technology is proposed},

  abstract  = {One of the main limitations of image search based on bag-of-features is the memory usage per image. Only a few million images can be handled on a single machine in reasonable response time. In this paper, we first evaluate how the memory usage is reduced by using lossless index compression. We then propose an approximate representation of bag-of-features obtained by projecting the corresponding histogram onto a set of pre-defined sparse projection functions, producing several image descriptors. Coupled with a proper indexing structure, an image is represented by a few hundred bytes. A distance expectation criterion is then used to rank the images. Our method is at least one order of magnitude faster than standard bag-of-features while providing excellent search quality.},

  abstract  = {This paper improves recent methods for large scale image search. State-of-the-art methods build on the bag-of-features image representation. We, first, analyze bag-of-features in the framework of approximate nearest neighbor search. This shows the sub-optimality of such a representation for matching descriptors and leads us to derive a more precise representation based on 1) Hamming embedding (HE) and 2) weak geometric consistency constraints (WGC). HE provides binary signatures that refine the matching based on visual words. WGC filters matching descriptors that are not consistent in terms of angle and scale. HE and WGC are integrated within the inverted file and are efficiently exploited for all images, even in the case of very large datasets. Experiments performed on a dataset of one million of images show a significant improvement due to the binary signature and the weak geometric consistency constraints, as well as their efficiency. Estimation of the full geometric transformation, i.e., a re-ranking step on a short list of images, is complementary to our weak geometric consistency constraints and allows to further improve the accuracy.},

  Abstract                 = {A multiple observation-based scheme (MObS) is described for robust facial recognition, and a novel object recognition method called kernel mutual subspace method (KMS) is proposed. The mutual sub-space method (MSM) proposed by (Maeda, et al., 1999) is a powerful method for recognizing facial images. However, its recognition accuracy is degraded when the data distribution has a nonlinear structure. To overcome this shortcoming we apply kernel principal component analysis (kPCP) to MSM. This paper describes theoretical aspects of the proposed method and presents the results of facial image recognition experiments},

Conditional random fields offer several advantages over hidden Markov models and stochastic grammars for such tasks, including the ability to relax strong independence assumptions made in those models. Conditional random fields also avoid a fundamental limitation of maximum entropy Markov models (MEMMs) and other discriminative Markov models based on directed graphical models, which can be biased towards states with few successor states. We present iterative parameter estimation algorithms for conditional random fields and compare the performance of the resulting models to HMMs and MEMMs on synthetic and natural-language data.},

The Mutual Subspace Method [19] is an extension of the Subspace Methods, in which canonical angles (principal angles) between two subspaces are used to define similarity between two patterns (or two sets of patterns). The method is applied to face recognition and character recognition in Toshiba Corporation. The Karhunen-Lo‘eve eigenvalue method or Principal Component Analysis (PCA) [8, 13, 17] is a well-known approach to form a subspace that approximates a distribution of patterns, and it was introduced as a tool of pattern recognition [10, 24]. The extension from the Subspace Methods to the Mutual Subspace Method corresponds to the difference between PCA and Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) [9]. In this chapter, the Mutual Subspace Method, its mathematical foundations and its applications are described.},

We discuss how to match 3-dimensional patterns, which are represented by a set of images taken from multiple directions and approximately represented by subspaces. The proposed method is to calculate the canonical angles, in particular the third smallest angle between two subspaces. We demonstrate the viability of the proposed method by performing a pilot study of face recognition.},

  Abstract                 = {This chapter proposes a representation of rigid three-dimensional (3D) objects in terms of local affine-invariant descriptors of their images and the spatial relationships between the corresponding surface patches. Geometric constraints associated with different views of the same patches under affine projection are combined with a normalized representation of their appearance to guide the matching process involved in object modeling and recognition tasks. The proposed approach is applied in two domains: (1) Photographs — models of rigid objects are constructed from small sets of images and recognized in highly cluttered shots taken from arbitrary viewpoints. (2) Video — dynamic scenes containing multiple moving objects are segmented into rigid components, and the resulting 3D models are directly matched to each other, giving a novel approach to video indexing and retrieval.},

  Abstract                 = {For many large undirected models that arise in real-world applications, exact maximumlikelihood training is intractable, because it requires computing marginal distributions of the model. Conditional training is even more difficult, because the partition function depends not only on the parameters, but also on the observed input, requiring repeated inference over each training example. An appealing idea for such models is to independently train a local undirected classifier over each clique, afterwards combining the learned weights into a single global model. In this paper, we show that this piecewise method can be justified as minimizing a new family of upper bounds on the log partition function. On three natural-language data sets, piecewise training is more accurate than pseudolikelihood, and often performs comparably to global training using belief propagation.},

Using wavelet features, it requires only approximate location of the text baseline and font size; no binarization or prior word segmentation is necessary. Our system is aided by a lexicon, yet it also allows non-lexicon words. To facilitate inference with a large lexicon, we use an approximate Viterbi beam search.

  Abstract                 = {Scene text images feature an abundance of font style variety but a dearth of data in any given query. Recognition methods must be robust to this variety or adapt to the query data's characteristics. To achieve this, we augment a semi-Markov model---integrating character segmentation and recognition---with a bigram model of character widths. Softly promoting segmentations that exhibit font metrics consistent with those learned from examples, we use the limited information available while avoiding error-prone direct estimates and hard constraints. Incorporating character width bigrams in this fashion improves recognition on low-resolution images of signs containing text in many fonts.},

  abstract  = {A common problem encountered in signboard recognition is the perspective distortion of characters. In this paper, we propose a method which is able to directly recognize characters under severe perspective distortion without perspective rectification. In this method, a character is represented by a sequence of cross ratio spectra, in which the perspective effect can be modeled as an one-dimensional uneven stretching. Dynamic Time Warping algorithm is employed to estimate the pairwise similarity between spectra of the query and spectra of a fronto-parallel template. Then, it is again used to find out the pixel-level correspondence and the similarity between the query and the template. The experiment results showed that the proposed method worked well on synthetic character images and signboards in real scene under severe perspective projections.},
